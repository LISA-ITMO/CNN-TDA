# CNN-TDA
We are discovering how data transitions of image batches influent on data's representations of learning CNN via topology data analysis methods.

Also we are comparing difference between stated classes' topologies and investigate on how some ML techinques improve CNN learning.

With this data we can explore AI goodness by some more universal metrics. 

# This work also includes contributions to eXNN library for TDA barcodes visualisation
